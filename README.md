## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Sass

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of accessibility and WAI-ARIA practices. Implementing these techniques helped improve the user experience, especially for users relying on assistive technologies.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on accessibility and WAI-ARIA practices to ensure a better user experience for all users.
